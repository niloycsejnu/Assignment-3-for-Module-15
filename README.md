 1. Server Setup: Use the http module to create an HTTP server.The server should listen on port 5500.When the server starts, it should log a message to the console indicating that it is listening on port 5500.
 2. Route Handling:
   -  Home Page (/): When the server receives a request to the root URL (/), it should respond with the text: "This is the Home Page".
   -  About Page (/about): When the server receives a request to the /about URL, it should respond with the text: "This is the About Page".
   -  Contact Page (/contact): When the server receives a request to the /contact URL, it should respond with the text: "This is the Contact Page".
 3. File Operations:
   -  File Write (/file-write): When the server receives a request to the /file-write URL, use the fs.writeFile() method to create a file named demo.txt. The file should contain the text "hello world". After writing the file, send an appropriate response to the client.
 4. Response Termination: Ensure that you end the server response using res.end() for each request.
